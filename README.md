# About this branch
Training Faster RCNN for face detection on WIDER, inspired by [playerkk](https://github.com/playerkk/face-py-faster-rcnn). Additions are mainly the WIDER dataset adapter and ground truth visualization for testing on FDDB.

Note: FC6 & FC7 are reduced to 1024 to fit 3GB video RAM.

### TODO
- [ ] Documentation on traning & testing procedure
